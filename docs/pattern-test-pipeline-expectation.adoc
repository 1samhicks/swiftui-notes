== Testing a publisher with XCTestExpectation

__Goal__::

* For testing a publisher (and any pipeline attached)

__References__::

* << link to reference pages>>

__See also__::

* << link to other patterns>>

__Code and explanation__::

* set up an expectation (`XCTestExpectation`)
* create your publisher & relevant pipeline if so desired
* create a sink to capture the results that works on both completions and values
** this can be separate, or just chained to the pipeline, depending on what makes most sense to you
* `wait` on the expectation to let the test "do it's thing" in the background

// force a page break - in HTML rendering is just a <HR>
