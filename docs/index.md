## SwiftUI Notes

A collection of notes, project pieces, playgrounds and ideas on learning and using SwiftUI and Combine.

Combine is Apple's functional reactive library. In Apple's words, it provides "a declarative Swift API
for processing values over time".

## Combine Basics

The [Combine online documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine)
can be found at https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine.

Additionally, there are video sessions from WWDC which introduce and provide an overview to Combine:
