## SwiftUI Notes

A collection of notes, project pieces, playgrounds and ideas on learning and using SwiftUI and Combine.

Combine is a unified declarative framework for processing values over time. It is Apple's framework that
is built using the functional reactive concepts that can be found in other languages. If you are already familar
with ReactiveX extensions, there is [a pretty good cheat-sheet for translating the specifics between Rx and Combine](https://medium.com/gett-engineering/rxswift-to-apples-combine-cheat-sheet-e9ce32b14c5b), built and inspired by
the data collected at [https://github.com/freak4pc/rxswift-to-combine-cheatsheet](https://github.com/freak4pc/rxswift-to-combine-cheatsheet).

Combine is Apple's functional reactive library. In Apple's words, it provides "a declarative Swift API
for processing values over time".

## Apple's documentation and content

The [Combine online documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine)
can be found at [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine).

Additionally, there are video sessions from WWDC which introduce and provide an overview to Combine:
