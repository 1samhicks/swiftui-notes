# SwiftUI Notes

A collection of notes, project pieces, playgrounds and ideas on learning and using
SwiftUI and Combine.

This site may be short-lived, as I hope it will be overtaken by Apple's documentation.

In the meantime, it is an open collection pulling and combining ideas and examples
from the community, conversations, and Apple's existing documentation. If you'd like
to suggest a change, correction, etc - I'll happily take pull-requests to this repository,
or you can [open an issue](https://github.com/heckj/swiftui-notes/issues/new/choose).

The source for all this content, as well as example project work (and playgrounds) is
on github at [https://github.com/heckj/swiftui-notes](https://github.com/heckj/swiftui-notes).
