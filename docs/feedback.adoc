Thank you for taking a look and providing feedback.

I am looking for feedback on several different topics, primarily around format and ease of use.
The contents of the book are __very__ early draft, and minimal to no editing, spell checking, or grammar review has yet been done.
While I'm happy to take feedback (or corrections) on those flaws, I'm more interesting in overall structural feedback.
Jump down to <<getting-the-book>> for links and URL references to the content in its various formats.

== Feedback Topics

Please send feedback to me at mailto:heckj@mac.com[heckj@mac.com]

=== Reference layout

Quite possibly the most work pending, and very little of this is "automated", so I'd like to get some solid feedback on the format I'm using.
Content pattern in question shown at https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/#reference-catch

Specific questions:

The layout currently follows a formula:

* Summary
* Constraints
* Apple doc ref
* Usage (internal links to patterns)
* Details (more explanation)

For operators in particular, I'm thinking of trying to add "marble diagrams" to help explain what each operator does.

**Q?**: Are any of the sections "noise" to you? (Not useful?)

**Q?**: Is there anything that you'd prefer to see that isn't there?

**Q?**: I'm writing unit tests and sample code in the associated project to frequently check how things work, would it be worth linking to that code?

=== How to fund

I don't expect to ever make a fortune writing, but there are some costs associated with this that I want to cover.
Specifically I want to hire a copy-editor to help, and possibly hiring assistance with making diagrams.
I'm considering different ways to deliver, and fund, this work.

What do you think makes the most sense?

Set up a Patreon account and accept a "help the book" project pledge::

* Add a section to the book thanking the contributors by name

Set up a Gumroad account and request people purchase the PDF or ePub version::

* I'm thinking charging something like $30 or $40
* If I go this route, do you think it's worthwhile to also have the PDF and/or ePub freely available?

Something else?::

* Got another funding pattern that you've seen and liked?

=== How to fund

**Q?**: Anything else?

Any other suggestions, content recommendations, or such that you'd like to see?
