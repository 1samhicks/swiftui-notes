= Choosing Combine

Combine fits most easily with other frameworks that have built in publishers.
The most obvious of which is SwiftUI, the declarative user interface framework that works across all of Apple's platforms.

RealityKit is also built with publishers.

Any API that provides asynchronous operations *can* be leverage with Combine.
