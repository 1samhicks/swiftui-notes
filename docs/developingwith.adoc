* https://github.com/heckj/swiftui-notes/issues/42[#42]

== developing with and for combine

integrating APIs into combine:

* as publisher (returning a publisher)

* as a subscriber (accepting data to do something...)

declaratively pipelines

- decide what you want it to do
- map through the types needed, and error handling

To integrate an external API into a pipeline
- map & switchToLatest
- flatMap
- sequenced pipelines, linked with subjects (or @Published)

== reasoning about pipelines

* one-shot

* continuous

effect on demand, (note subjects obscure specific demand)
- demand is a local effect only

== how to create a subscriber/implementing your own subscriber

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/subscriber[Subscriber]

types:
* Input
* Failure

required functions:
* receive(Self.Input) -> Subscribers.Demand
* receive(subscription: Subscription)
* receive(completion: Subscribers.Completion<Self.Failure>)

* receive() -> Subscribers.Demand (when input void)

== implementing your own publisher

* covered this a bit in the patterns section...
